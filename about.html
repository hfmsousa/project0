    <h1> About me: </h1>

    <p>Dr Helder Sousa is an expert, with 17 years of international experience and strong exposure to the industry
        sector, on Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applied on Civil Engineering infrastructures and Visiting
        Professor at the University of Surrey, UK, where he teaches in the fields of Bridge Management and
        Infrastructure Asset Management.</p>
    <p>With core expertise in structures of Civil Engineering (<a
            href="https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/68424" target="_blank">PhD Thesis, 2012</a>), his
        scientific knowledge spans from (before PhD conclusion) advanced Finite Element Analysis of full-scale
        structures to (after PhD conclusion) Bayesian statistics and Value of Information theory, mainly single and
        sequential updating methods, passing through wide experience in tacking big-data streams collected by monitoring
        systems installed on full-scale bridges. Altogether makes Dr Sousa holding a holistic and singular profile with
        a comprehensive view and perception on the different levels of science, i.e. fundamental research and applied
        research.</p>
    <p>With 46 conference papers, 15 scientific journal papers, 2 book chapters, more than 35 oral presentations in
        several countries of Europe and beyond, as well as 4 short-scientific missions at top leading R&D Institutes in
        Europe (ETH Zurich in Switzerland, TNO R&D institute in Netherlands, CEREMA in France and COWI in Denmark),
        makes Dr Sousa has one of the recognized researchers in his research field.</p>
    <p>Awarded with several research grants and consultancy funding, highlighting his Individual Marie Skłodowska-Curie
        Fellowship (<a href="http://www.lostprecon.eu/ target=" _blank"">LostPreCon project, 2015-17</a>) and his recent
        role as the leader of the Innovation Committee of the European COST Action TU1402 – Quantifying the Value of
        Structural Health Monitoring, as a legal representative of the BRISA Group (<a
            href="https://www.cost-tu1402.eu/Action/Innovation-Committee target=" _blank"">TU1402, 2014-19</a>).
        Currently, he is Guest Editor in the top-ranked scientific journal Structure & Infrastructure Engineering and
        (co-)leads two special sessions in the next European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (Italy, 2020) and
        in the 13th ASCE Specialty Conference on Probabilistic Mechanics and Reliability (New York, 2020). His enrolment
        in scientific committees at the European level and wide experience in acting as a reviewer for national and
        international science councils is also a clear demonstration of his leadership and independence skills.</p>
