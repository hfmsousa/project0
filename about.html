    <h1> About me: </h1>

    <p>Dr Helder Sousa is an expert, with 17 years of international experience and strong exposure to the industry
        sector, on Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applied on Civil Engineering infrastructures and Visiting
        Professor at the University of Surrey, UK, where he teaches in the fields of Bridge Management and
        Infrastructure Asset Management.</p>
    <p>With core expertise in structures of Civil Engineering (<a
            href="https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/68424" target="_blank">PhD Thesis, 2012</a>), his
        scientific knowledge spans from (before PhD conclusion) advanced Finite Element Analysis of full-scale
        structures to (after PhD conclusion) Bayesian statistics and Value of Information theory, mainly single and
        sequential updating methods, passing through wide experience in tacking big-data streams collected by monitoring
        systems installed on full-scale bridges. Altogether makes Dr Sousa holding a holistic and singular profile with
        a comprehensive view and perception on the different levels of science, i.e. fundamental research and applied
        research.</p>
